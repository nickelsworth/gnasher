   This is a variation of the old PacMan game with some twists.
   FULL TURBO PASCAL SOURCE CODE IS INCLUDED.

   The "monsters" search in your DIRECTION - and they can see
   through walls! They can even "smell" you through the exit holes at the
   sides! You have to figure out a strategy to finish a level before
   your oxygen is used up! (Trap the monsters in certain places of the
   maze). It is also best to keep the monsters "together".

   You can use the source code to learn about Pascal. May be compiled
   using Turbo Pascal 5.5, 6.0, 7.0.

   You are encouraged to make new innovations, e.g. better graphics
   of the moving figures. (Originally the program was written on a CP/M
   machine (Gemini) where the graphics were used for better graphics of
   the monsters and the "pacman").

   The feature of eating power pellets which reverses the direction of
   the monsters is not included in the present version of the program,
   but you might add it!

   If you make some improvements, please send a copy!

   Hope you will enjoy it!

   Yours sincerely,
